Notes about the OpenOCD configuration

OpenOCD can now read multiple configurations from a single XML file.
Each configuration is in a separate <Cfg> tag. 
Each tag which must have a unique "id" property, which is displayed in the select plugin dialogue, and two subtags: <Init> and <Run>.

When detect_interfaces is called, the <Init> section of each configuration is executed. Each configuration which allows a successful initialisation of the JTAG interface is shown in the plugin selector, using the id attribute as the screen name.
When a configuration is selected, both the <Init> and <Run> sections of this configuration are executed.

Added progress display to fn_read_image/fn_write_image
Added handling of DCC messages. Messages are shown in the log window, or, while fn_call is running with a callback, re-directed to the callback.

The jtag_device configuration instruction has been extended to check device ids:
jtag_device ir_length   expected_ircapture_value  expected_ircapture_mask [idcode_instr expected_idcode]
(idcode_instr is ignored)

The script command has been changed to allow execution of scripts in config phase.
The paths in the script and load_image commands are relative to the location of muhkuh.exe or serverkuh.exe.
